# Simple GitHub Webhook
A simple, Node.js based webhook meant for shell-script based deployment!

# Usage

## Step 1. Installing

Let's say you just want to use this for fast and easy deployment for your web
project. First thing's first clone this repository and install the required
dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/melonmanchan/simple-github-webhook
cd simple-github-webhook
npm install
```

While you're at it, you should also edit the deploy.sh script to be more
suitable for your deployment needs, or replace it entirely with your own
command!

## Step 2. Starting it up

The webhook can be customized with the following five parameters, passed in
through environment variables:


Variable  | Meaning | Default
------------- | ------------- | -------------
COMMAND  | The command that is run on a succesful webhook  | ./deploy.sh
SECRET  | The GitHub secret for authentication | None (required!)
HOOK_PATH  | The sub-path that the script runs under | /
PORT  | The port the script runs under | 8080
BRANCH  | The git branch that the webhook is listening for commits | undefined (all)

So for example, if you'd like to listen to changes to the feature-foo branch on
port 1337 and run a script every time someone commits to the branch in
question, you'd start the webhook by:

```sh
PORT=1337 COMMAND='/my/neat/script.sh' SECRET='My secret secret' BRANCH='feature-foo' npm start
```

Output:

```sh
GitHub webhook running at: http://10.11.12.13:1337/
Listening for commits to branch refs/heads/feature-foo
Will run following command on authenticated request: ./deploy.sh
```

## Step 2. Setting up your repository on GitHub

First, go to your repository's setting page, click on "Webhooks and services",
and click on the button on the top right, labeled "Add webhook"

GitHub will then prompt you for your password.

Next, fill in the correct URL, path and secret that you specified and received
while starting the webhook.

That should be enough to get your webhook up and running! Feel free to make a
test commit or two to the branch you specified at the start to test it.

```sh
Running deployment now...
# SCRIPT OUTPUT HERE
Deployment finished!
```
